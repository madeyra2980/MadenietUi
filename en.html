                The first artists who laid the foundation for the development of amateur art were Kailash Nurgazin,
                Askarbek Karimov, Rysbek Shalkhanov, Kairgazy Dyusembaev, Valentina Ermolaeva, and the Askarov family
                duet.
                Kailash Nurgazin is a talented local composer and cultural worker. He is the author of more than 50
                musical works. A laureate of the All-Union Amateur Art Review, his songs — simple in execution yet
                heartfelt and meaningful — are well known and loved among fellow villagers. Especially dear to every
                resident of Beskaragai is Nurgazin’s song “Beskaragai,” which has become a symbolic anthem of the
                district, known by both young and old.

                His compositions are diverse in theme, form, and style. Among the most popular are patriotic songs such
                as “My East Kazakhstan,” “Tugan zher,” “Good Morning, My Kazakhstan”; songs about mothers like “Anashym,
                Anazhan,” “Ballad About Mother,” “Mother’s Hands”; songs about nature — “Rain Over Semipalatinsk,”
                “White Bird Cherry,” “Blue Evening”; and lyrical songs like “Eastern Girl,” “Dombra,” “Enlightenment,”
                and many others.

                His work as a composer harmonized well with his visual artistic pursuits. Kailash Nurgazin is the author
                of the monument dedicated to fallen fellow villagers located on the main square of the district center,
                where flowers are laid during commemorative events. He also designed the district’s logo, skillfully
                depicting the key natural riches of the Beskaragai District: the pine forest, Irtysh River, and
                Balapan’s grain fields.

                Kailash Baymakovich Nurgazin has received numerous certificates, diplomas, and letters of appreciation
                and has been honored with the title “Honorary Citizen of Beskaragai District.”

                For over 40 years, Kailash Nurgazin devoted his life to the cultural development of the Beskaragai
                District. For many years, he led the District House of Culture.

                The District House of Culture is a foundational cultural institution that forms a significant part of
                the cultural potential not only of the district's public life center but of the entire Beskaragai
                District. It is not just a place for spiritual recreation — it is an educational institution and a
                center for developing the creative abilities of children and youth.

                The building of the District House of Culture in Beskaragai was constructed in 1978. The district is
                known for its talented individuals who, over the years, have made substantial contributions to its
                cultural development. The House of Culture hosted the formation of a vocal-instrumental ensemble and the
                folk dance ensemble “Exiton.”

                Today, 8 creative groups operate at the District House of Culture, 2 of which hold the honorary titles
                “Folk” and “Exemplary.” The creative team is constantly evolving, introducing new and modern directions
                in choreography and vocals.

                The artists of the District House of Culture are laureates and diploma winners of numerous contests and
                festivals. Traditional song performer on the dombra, Erkyn Motyshev, was awarded the “For Distinguished
                Labor” medal and is a diploma winner of the national competition named after Aset Naimanbayev.
                Choreographer Galina Ovsyannikova leads the Exemplary Dance Ensemble “Charodei,” which won the Grand
                Prix at the international competition “Altyn Samruk.”

                The following choreographers and vocalists delight audiences with their bright creative performances:
                Asem Asilkhanova, Dinara Muratbayeva, Aidar Karimov, Aset Toleuov, Guldana Orazbekova, Kymbat Satkenova,
                Zhan Alzhanov, Bizhan Alimzhanova, Zhazira Konurshina, Asem Alimkhanova, Dinara Rustemova.
